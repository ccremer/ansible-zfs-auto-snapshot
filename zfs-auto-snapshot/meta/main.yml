    Installs zfs-auto-snapshot for automatic snapshotting your ZFS datasets. Cron and ZFS need to be installed,
    with 'zfs' in $PATH.
    Fails on inexistent datasets and requires root access (sudo is sufficient). Tested on Debian.
    By default, ALL datasets will get snapshots. Override "autosnap_args" (which defaults to '--quiet --syslog')
    and add "--default-exclude" to enable snapshots only to those configured in "zfs_datasets" variable.
